Support Vector Machine

Support vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. 


What is an SVM?
• SVMs are used to build binary classifiers
• Make classification decision on basis of a
“linear function” of a point’s coordinates
• Does not require prior knowledge of
probability distribution of the points
• Involves an explicit training stage
